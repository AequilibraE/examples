# AliceSprings

This repository contains the data used to develop the AequilibraE model for the city of Alice Springs, in the Northern 
Territory of Australia.

The focus of both this repository and the aforementioned tutorial is not model validation in any shape or form, and we 
do not foresee the focus to be on forecast if a proper model development effort is undertaken.

ANY use of this data and model for financial gain or in a professional setting needs to include a disclaimer to the 
client where the data came from BEFORE or AT the inception of the project, and full credit given to its authors.

[The tutorial can be accessed online](http://www.aequilibrae.com/qgis/example.html)
